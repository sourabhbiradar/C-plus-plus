# while & Do while loops

- syntax :
while (condition){

}

while loop can be used as for loop
but we prefer not to.

- `break` keyword allows use to break out of loop. Even `for loop`.
  Even the rest of conditions are `true` still we will break out of loop once break hit.

- `continue` keyword allow us to skip iterstions.

- syntax : do{

}while(condition) 


no matter what atleast do-while will runs once.

if condition is ture do-while will run untill its false.
so to end loop while condition shud to loop termination condition.
