# functions 

functions are block of codes which perform specific tasks.

funcrions can be reused.

functions MAY take values known as parameters/arguements and MAY return value.

functions are terminated as so as they hit `return`.

functions are called/invoked from main() function.

functoins are placed above main() otherwise they are NOT recognized.

OR just use `function prototype` and write func anywhere outside main()

`void function` is a function that does NOT return anything.
