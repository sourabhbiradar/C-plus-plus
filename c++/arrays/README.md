# Arrays

Arrays are collection of data of similar type.

Array is series of elements of same data type placed in contigous memory locations.

Elements from array can be accessed using index.
index [0] [1] [2] ...

NOTE : to access all elements we use loops

Arrays size need to be defined , once defined array size can NOT excced that size.

When tried to access elements of uninitialized array we get some random numbers.
Do NOT try to access undefiend array or its elements.

To get size of an array we use `sizeof()` 
which gives how many `bytes` of memeory are being used.

formula : `sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0])`
