# switch statement

- syntax : 
switch (expression){
    case :
     << code >>
     break;

    default :
     << code >>
     break;
}

We can have multiple `cases`.

If non of the cases are true, `default` is executed.

Having `break` aftre every case is must otherwise all cases will be executed.

You can use if-else instead of switch.
